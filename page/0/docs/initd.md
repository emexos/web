# How emexOS starts programms after bootup

after booting emexOS you will probably see this messages:
```
Process List:
PID   State       Name            Entry Point
----  ----------  --------------  -----------
3     READY       app.elf         0x400A0000
2     READY       __rt            0x40001000
1     READY       kernel          0x40000000
:: emxrc: exec /user/apps/gui.emx (ep) &
:: emxrc: exec /emr/system/login.elf (elf)
```

the `:: emxrc:` is the initd/rc (run commands) which is the initialization daemon, you probably heard of daemons, like in linux `systemd`, or in macos `launchd` which are the first programms the kernel/OS starts after bootup.

In emexOS, the .emxrc file tells the initd system which program to start,
by simply opening the .emxrc file you can change which apps it will start and which not
you will see variables like:
```
var login_path = ("/emr/system/login.elf")
```
and the exec command like this:
```
exec login_path
```

this will execute the `login.elf` from `/emr/system/`

## How it works
the emxrc file is pretty simple,
you have variables`var` following with the variable name and the content of it.
the exec command is short for execution, it will execute a programm, using the path from a variable.

## formats
emexOS supports both `.elf` and a packaging format called `.emx`, if you want to execute elf programms you can simply use `exec /path/to/elf_file` but if you want to use other formats you need to use `-f"format"` e.g. `-f"ep"`
(ep is short for emex package). if you want to start programms in the background, not after each other then use `-bg`. to see how to create apps, read the article [how to create applications](create_applications.md)
