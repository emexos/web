# How to create applications

create a small programm using the emexOS libc and compile it into x86_64_elf then create a folder with the name of your app, use the extention .emx then move your elf file to *this* folder (which you created 1 step earlier), then simply move the .emx folder into /users/apps/ then start emexOS and start the app using exec /user/apps/your_app_name.emx (replace "your_app_name" with your actual name)

## load programms while booting up
in emexOS you can start programms directly at the begining using the .emxrc, if you want to know how [click here](initd.md)
